# Waste Management Projet
### Created by Gavin Jakubik and Edie Uebelhor

This project was created to track the total amount of waste exiting an Anheuser-Busch plant daily given the amount of each type of drink being produced that day. 

Usage: ./main.py [-n DRINKNAME -i PATH]  
     -n "DRINK NAME" Singular drink data, pass the name as "DRINK NAME", dont forget quotes  
     -i PATH         Specify path to data file (default drink-setup.txt)  
     -d DAYS         Specify number of days to do calculations for (default 1)  
     -g              Run Program with GUI  

Here is what the user sees when `./main.py -g` is run.
